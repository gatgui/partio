Partio4Maya / Partio Source  beta 0.9.5  (10-01-2013)  (unreleased in binary form) 
WHATS NEW:
-PartioInstancer now supports most rotation parameters the standard maya instancer will support
-PartioExport/GUI now supports Escape key interrupt in all modes.. command line, and GUI based exports.
-PartioInstancer PP text now properly supports writing vectors and floats 
-PartioVisualizer now updates cache path even if node is not active, 
  so you can  have a visualzier turned off and still render the frame correctly 

WHATS NEW in Partio Source:
-added initial Partio4Arnold  (see partio4Arnold contrib directory) 
----------------------------------------------------
Partio-core / Partio4Maya / Partio Source  beta 0.9.6  (10-31-2013)
WHATS NEW in the Partio-core:
-partview had some leaky mem, and crashing, which has been fixed, and  it now also supports  user right click menus  for  "color from and  "opacity from"  
  (this will need some testing on other Os's / graphics cards / drivers etc..) 
-Removed ICECache support from readers/writers for now, code needs to be updated to be cross platform compatible,
  it does not work in windows and didn't try on Osx at all,  at the moment and was crashing on  read/write  under linux as well...  

WHATS NEW in Partio4Maya:
-All memory leaks shoud now be fixed in all partio nodes! 
-PartioVisualizer viewport icon changes color when no cache is present or its turned inactive
-PartioExportGui now stores the checkbox status for each particle object on that object so when you re-open a scene or the partioExport window,
  you'll have your last exported particles already checked. 
--PartioExprortGui now more intelligently handles  file output path changes and  allows user to change file path in the text edit line if desired,
  for quick versioning up 
--All Partio nodes now support a "frameSkip" or "byFrame" attr for simple frame skip retimes  directly in the node.

WHATS NEW in Partio Source:
- Merged Milo Green's   Partio4Houdini  fork and set up proper project cmake build scripts for it.
  (see partio4Houdini contrib directory)

----------------------------------------------------
Partio-core / Partio4Maya / Partio Source  beta 0.9.7  (??-??-??)

COMING SOON!
